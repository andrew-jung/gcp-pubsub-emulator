# GCP PubSub Emulator for Local Development

### Build the Docker image:
- `docker build . -t gcppubsub:latest`

### Run:
- `docker run -p 8085:8085 gcp-pubsub-dev:latest`

### Test connection with curl:
- test with curl: `http://localhost:8085` or `0.0.0.0:8085`
- Host and ports can be passed as part of building the image

### Make REST API calls:
- Projects are created "on the fly" when creating topics
- Create a topic: `PUT http://localhost:8085/v1/projects/test/topics/cats` where `cats` is a new topic name and `test` is the project
- Get project topics `GET http://localhost:8085/v1/projects/test/topics`
- Publish message to topic: `POST http://localhost:8085/v1/projects/test/topics/cats:publish`
-   - Payload:
        ```
        â€‹{"messages": [{"data": "cats rule"}]}
        ````

- Curl samples: https://github.com/robertsicoie/gcp-pubsub-samples

### Clean up build stage image:
- `docker image prune --filter label=stage=builder`
### TODO:
- Do we need configurable hosts/ports?
